Our Goal

Build a real-time app displaying recently tweeted about foods that clicks through to foursquare and/or yelp.

Steps

1. Connect to twitter to get a live stream of tweets related to food.

2. Push new tweets through to users in real time.

3. Build a word cloud with words linking to yelp/foursquare.

Bonus

1. Make it sexy (just a little bit).

2. Save words in mongo and show a graph of popular foods over time.
